# wikidata-foi

This pipeline generates PMD Feature of Interest data for CORD Geographies.

The input is a [csv with codes including wikidata IDs](resources/cord-geographies-wikidata.csv) (this was prepared using OpenRefine).

Run the test pipeline:

    $ lein run test/resources/eg-wikidata.csv cord-foi-test.nq

Run the full pipeline (WIP):

    $ lein run resources/cord-geographies-wikidata.csv cord-foi.nq

The resources folder also contains a world boundary taken from [Natural Earth Vector Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/) and "dissolved" into a single WKT boundary using QGIS.

The [Jenkinsfile](./Jenkinsfile) describes the overall process.
